# Auth0App

This is a single page app to login through Auth0 authentication and fetch all apps and rules in exisitng account.
Original idea is categorise these rules based on apps and displaying it after login. This work however is Work in Progress.

To try exisitng code:

1. Download the code and run "npm-intall" on app directory.
2. Update auth0-variables with you Auth0 domain and token.
3. As this app uses Management API, you would need to set Management API details as well on this above js file.
4. Once done, run "npm-start".
5. Your site will be hosting on localhost:3000

This will get you all apps and rules which "currently" you can show in console on Chrome developer tool.
Once completed it should display the related data after login on screen.
